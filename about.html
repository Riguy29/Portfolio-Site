            <p>
              I grew up in Green Bay, Wisconsin, in the shadow of Lambeau Field.
              As an only child for the first eight years of my life, I was not
              thrilled having to deal with a little sister, we have only grown
              closer over the years. In 2016, I was blessed with a half brother
              and it has been an wonderful experience to watch him grow up. I
              have always been a nerd at heart, as a child you couldn't pull me
              away from computers and tech. Whether it was disasembling a
              calculator to get a sneak peak at the circuit board inside or
              downloading Skyrim's modding tools to investigate how my favorite
              game worked, I couldn't keep my hands away for tech.

            <p>
              I took my first computer science class, Fundamentals of Computer
              Science, during my sophmore year at Southwest Highschool. This
              class introduced me to some of the most basic aspects of software
              through the use of the block-based learning program Scratch. As
              part of the class, we also had a module focused on web
              developments where we used Adobe Dreamweaver to explore basic
              HTML,CSS, and Javascript. During my final year, I took the newly
              introduced Computer Science AP course, in which we dove further
              into the nitty gritty of computers and learned about algorithms,
              object-oriented programming, and some basic design patterns. After
              those first few programming classes I was hooked and I knew I
              wanted to purse computer science further. My first year in college
              was spent at Northwestern Technical College, which had a direct
              transfer program with UWGB. I was able to knock out a good portion
              of my general education requirements and one or two programming
              classes. I graduated from the University of Green Bay with a
              degree in Computer science, with emphasis in both software
              engineering and cybersecurity

              When I'm not at working or running errands, you can usually find
