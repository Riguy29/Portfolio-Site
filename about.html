              I grew up in Green Bay, Wisconsin, in the shadow of Lambeau Field.
              As an only child for the first eight years of my life, I was not
              thrilled about having to deal with a little sister, but we have
              only grown closer over the years. In 2016, I was blessed with a
              half-brother and it has been a wonderful experience to watch him
              grow up. I have always been a nerd at heart. As a child, you
              couldn't pull me away from computers and tech. Whether it was
              disassembling a calculator to get a sneak peek at the circuit
              board inside or downloading Skyrim's modding tools to investigate
              how my favorite game worked, I couldn't keep my hands away from
              tech. I currently reside in Green Bay and live with an adorable
              little orange cat, Fae.

              I took my first computer science class, Fundamentals of Computer
              Science, during my sophmore year at Southwest Highschool. This
              class introduced me to some of the most basic aspects of software
              through the use of the block-based learning program Scratch. As
              part of the class, we also had a module focused on web
              developments where we used Adobe Dreamweaver to explore basic
              HTML,CSS, and Javascript. During my final year, I took the newly
              introduced Computer Science AP course, in which we dove further
              into the nitty gritty of computers and learned about algorithms,
              object-oriented programming, and some basic design patterns. After
              those first few programming classes I was hooked and I knew I
              wanted to purse computer science further. My first year in college
              was spent at Northwestern Technical College, which had a direct
              transfer program with UWGB. I was able to knock out a good portion
              of my general education requirements and one or two programming
              classes. I graduated from the University of Green Bay with a
              degree in Computer science, with emphasis in both software
              engineering and cybersecurity

              When I'm not working or running errands, you can usually find me
              catching up on the latest nerd media, tinkering with new
              technologies, or prepping for my latest Dungeons and Dragons
              campaign. I was first exposed to D&D in high school when some
              other students invited me to join them for a one-shot. Although a
              little nerve-racking at first, I quickly fell in love with it.
              After numerous sessions as a player, I wanted to try my hand at
              being the one who makes it all possible, the DM. I bought the DM's
              guide and got to work. Using a premade campaign setting, I ran my
              first session and had even more fun than when I was a player. Ever
              since, I have been consistently running games for friends,
              coworkers, and anyone who has an inkling of interest in it. I have
              also expanded into different TTRPG systems such as Call of Cthulu
              and the Fantasy Flight Star Wars System. I also enjoy spending an
              afternoon here and huddling up, playing the latest and greatest
              AAA game, or exploring a cozy indie game. Video games can be some
              of the most powerful art made, and it's a shame that some people
              look down on them. Games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Red Dead
              Redemption have some of the most impactful stories and have
              brought actual tears to my eyes.
